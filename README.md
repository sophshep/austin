## GitHub Offices, Coworking space

None officially, but:

## Neighborhoods

* Downtown - Central, close to everything.
* East Austin (east of I-35, north of the river) - Rapidly gentrifying, cool part of town. Lots of great restaurants & bars, close to downtown.
* South Congress / South First - two parallel streets just south of the river. Lots of shopping (vintage clothes, records, etc)

## Hotels

* [The Heywood](https://www.heywoodhotel.com/) - small, 7 room boutique hotel in East Austin. Perfect for small mini-summits, you can reserve all the rooms and have the run of the place (best of both worlds with an AirBNB & hotel)

## Coffee/brunch/breakfast

* [Brew + Brew](http://www.thebrewandbrew.com/) - great coffee, breakfast tacos, [bagels](http://www.rosensbagels.com/), in East Austin near downtown, good for coworking. If you hang out there through the afternoon/evening, they also serve beer.
* [Flat Track](https://flattrackcoffee.com/) - Coffee / bike shop. Ultimate Austin.
* [Houndstooth](https://www.houndstoothcoffee.com/) and [Cafe Medici](https://caffemedici.com/) both have multiple locations and serve the best coffee in Austin.
* [Radio](http://radiocoffeeandbeer.com/) - a bit further south but worth the trip. Coffee and beer served out of an old house, surrounded by food trucks, including [Veracruz All Natural](http://www.veracruzallnatural.com/) (which many say has the best migas breakfast taco)

## Nightlife
* [White Horse](https://www.thewhitehorseaustin.com/) - Bar / dancehall on the East Side. Live music & dancing most nights. Great mix of people always - from older folks to east side hipsters.
* [Broken Spoke](https://www.brokenspokeaustintx.net/) - An old Texas Honky Tonk. My personal favorite.
* [Ego's Karaoke](https://www.yelp.com/biz/egos-austin) - If you're a person who loves to do karaoke

## Sightseeing & Activities
* Lady Bird Lake Hike & Bike trail - 10 mile trail around the water downtown (has lots of bridges for smaller loops). Great for jogging.
* Kayaking / Canoeing / Stand Up Paddleboarding - you can rent any of these at [The Rowing Dock](https://www.rowingdock.com/)
* Peter Pan mini-golf
* [Alamo Drafthouse](https://drafthouse.com/austin) - the theatre that serves you food and drinks. They're in lots of cities now, but they're from Austin.
* Blanton Museum - art museum on UT campus. Home of Elsworth Kelly's piece "Austin".

## Volunteering

* [Casa Marianella](http://www.casamarianella.org/) is a homeless shelter dedicated solely to immigrants seeking asylum. They often need cleaning, cooking, or house repair help.
* [Central Texas Food Bank](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/)
* http://ilivehereigivehere.org/ is a great resource for local organizations looking for volunteers

## Public Transport

* If you plan on staying in the city, Uber and Lyft are available. 
* We also have a local, nonprofit ridesharing app called [Ride Austin](http://www.rideaustin.com/). It works just like Uber but the drivers get a larger cut and profits get donated to local organizations.
* If you plan on leaving the city, I would recommend renting a car at the airport.
