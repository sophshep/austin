## GitHub Offices, Coworking space

None officially, but:
* [WeWork South Congress](https://www.wework.com/buildings/congress--austin--TX)

## Neighborhoods

* Downtown - Central, close to everything, 
* East Austin (east of I-35, north of the river) - Rapidly gentrifying, cool part of town. Lots of great restaurants & bars, close to downtown.
* South Congress / South First - two parallel streets just south of the river. Lots of shopping 

## Hotels

* [The Heywood](https://www.heywoodhotel.com/) - small, 7 room boutique hotel in East Austin. Perfect for small mini-summits, you can reserve all the rooms and have the run of the place (best of both worlds with an AirBNB & hotel)
* [Hotel Van Zandt](http://www.hotelvanzandt.com/) - New Kimpton hotel near downtown

## Coffee/brunch/breakfast

* [Brew + Brew](http://www.thebrewandbrew.com/) - great coffee, breakfast tacos, [bagels](http://www.rosensbagels.com/), in East Austin near downtown, good for coworking. If you hang out there through the afternoon/evening, they also serve beer.
* [Flat Track](https://flattrackcoffee.com/) - Coffee / bike shop. Ultimate Austin.
* [Houndstooth](https://www.houndstoothcoffee.com/) and [Cafe Medici](https://caffemedici.com/) both have multiple locations and serve the best coffee in Austin.
* [Radio](http://radiocoffeeandbeer.com/) - a bit further south but worth the trip. Coffee and beer served out of an old house, surrounded by food trucks, including [Veracruz All Natural](http://www.veracruzallnatural.com/) (which many say has the best migas breakfast taco)

## Casual Restaurants
* [Torchy's Tacos](https://torchystacos.com/) - An Austin taco institution
* [La Barbecue](https://www.labarbecue.com/) - As good as the esteemed Franklin BBQ, but less waiting in line.
* [Matt's El Rancho](http://mattselrancho.com/) - Classic Tex Mex and good margaritas. Good for large groups.
* [Ramen Tatsuya](http://ramen-tatsuya.com/) - Best ramen in Austin

## Fancier Restaurants

## Bars

## Nightlife

## Sightseeing

## Fun things that don't involve alcohol

## Volunteering

* [Casa Marianella](http://www.casamarianella.org/) is a homeless shelter dedicated solely to immigrants seeking asylum. They often need cleaning, cooking, or house repair help.
* [Central Texas Food Bank](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/)
* http://ilivehereigivehere.org/ is a great resource for local organizations looking for volunteers

## Public Transport

* If you plan on staying in the city, Uber and Lyft are available. 
* We also have a local, nonprofit ridesharing app called [Ride Austin](http://www.rideaustin.com/). It works just like Uber but the drivers get a larger cut and 
* If you plan on leaving the city, I would recommend renting a car at the airport.
